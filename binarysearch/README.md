# Binary Search
Binary search is an algorithm whose input is a sorted list of elements. 
If an element we are looking for is in the list, binary search returns the position where it is located.
Otherwise, binary search returns null.

Binary search approaches the middle number and eliminate half the remaining numbers every time.

***Running time***:

* In the worst case, binary search takes *log2(n)* steps for any list of *n*.
* Logarithmic time: **O(log n)**


## Examples
